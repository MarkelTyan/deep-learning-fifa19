# deep-learning-fifa19
In general, as stated in the practice assignment, this activity aims to follow the process of building a deep artificial neural network for a classification problem using the Fifa19 dataset. The goal is to estimate the overall quality of football players based on their skills as a classification task.

The work material provided for the practice includes the following:

▪ FootballPlayerRawDataset.csv: A file containing the dataset of football players to be classified according to their attributes. This is the raw information from which the processed dataset (cleaned and encoded) is extracted to be processed by the artificial neural network to be implemented.

▪ PreparingFootballPlayerDataset.ipynb: A Google Colab® notebook used for preprocessing the dataset (FootballPlayerRawDataset.csv file). Thus, this notebook is executed to clean and prepare the data and obtain the resulting files to feed the neural models. Later modified for an increased performance of the network.

In addition, Google Colab® has been used through the "notebooks" (.ipynb files) with which this tool works, for the implementation and execution of the artificial neural network. To do this, the work material has been used to obtain the files that feed the artificial neural network that has been implemented and, subsequently, a stage of adjustment and testing of the network's hyperparameters has been carried out to obtain the most accurate results.
